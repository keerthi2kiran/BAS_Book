# Chapter 10: Identifying Directions & Finding the Pole Star

Knowing how to identify directions in the night sky is fundamental to successful stargazing. The **Pole Star (Polaris)** is particularly important because it remains almost fixed in the northern sky.

## Cardinal Directions at Night

Learning to find directions at night helps you navigate the sky easily:

- **West**: Direction where the Sun sets.
- **East**: Opposite the sunset point; direction where celestial objects rise.
- **North and South**: Perpendicular to the East-West line.

### Activity:
- At dusk, stand facing the sunset. Your left side points south, and right side points north.

## Identifying Polaris (The North Star)

### Why Polaris?
- It is located nearly at the celestial north pole and appears stationary.
- Used as a reference to find other celestial objects and directions.

### How to Find Polaris:
1. Locate the constellation **Ursa Major (Big Dipper)**.
2. Identify the two stars at the end of the Dipper's bowl (**Dubhe and Merak**).
3. Draw an imaginary line connecting these two stars and extend it about five times their spacing.
4. This line leads directly to **Polaris**, the brightest star in the constellation **Ursa Minor (Little Dipper)**.

## Activity: Tracking Polaris

- Observe Polaris at different times during the night.
- Note that it remains in roughly the same position, while other stars circle around it.

## Southern Hemisphere Directions

Observers at your latitude (13°N) can see many southern sky highlights. To find south:

- Locate the **Southern Cross (Crux)** low in the southern sky.
- Extend the long axis of the cross approximately 4.5 times its length to identify the southern celestial pole.

### Illustration:

## Fun Fact: Pole Stars Change!

Due to Earth's axial precession (slow wobble), the pole star changes over thousands of years. Polaris hasn't always been—and won't always remain—the pole star.
