# Observation Logging & Astro Sketching

Recording your observations is an essential skill in astronomy. Keeping a log helps track celestial objects, sky conditions, and improvements in your observing skills.

## Why Keep an Observation Log?

- Helps you **track objects** you have observed.
- Improves your **understanding of celestial changes** over time.
- Allows you to **compare observations** under different conditions.

### What to Include in Your Log:
| Entry | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Date & Time** | Record the date, start & end time of observation. |
| **Location** | Note your observing site & any light pollution factors. |
| **Weather Conditions** | Transparency, seeing, temperature, humidity. |
| **Equipment Used** | Telescope/binoculars, eyepieces, filters. |
| **Object Observed** | Name, catalog number (Messier/NGC), type. |
| **Observation Details** | Features seen, brightness, color, motion. |
| **Sketch** | A rough drawing of what you observed. |

## Astro Sketching

Sketching helps **train your eye** to see fine details at the eyepiece.

### Basic Sketching Steps:
1. **Start with a blank circle** (field of view).
2. **Mark bright stars** first.
3. **Fill in deep sky object** details (shape, structure, brightness).
4. **Use shading techniques** for nebulosity or galaxies.
5. **Write notes** about brightness variations, colors, etc.

## Sketching Different Objects

- **Planets**: Mark major features (cloud bands, rings, moons).
- **Lunar Craters**: Use shading for depth.
- **Nebulae & Galaxies**: Soft pencil strokes for diffuse structures.
- **Star Clusters**: Place stars carefully with varying brightness.

### Activity:
- Sketch the **Orion Nebula (M42)** and note the **Trapezium stars**.

## Tools for Logging & Sketching

- **Notebook or Digital App**: SkySafari, Stellarium, etc.
- **Pencils & Erasers**: HB & 2B pencils for sketching.
- **Red Flashlight**: To preserve night vision.
- **Template Printouts**: Pre-drawn circles for sketches.
